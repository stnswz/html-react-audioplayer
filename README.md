Example application for a html audio player. The application is implemented in React JS / TypeScript, uses Redux, Redux-Thunk and is fully responsive. You can see the player in action on [react-audioplayer.netlify.com](https://react-audioplayer.netlify.com).

Based on this html audio player, I also created a simple example html video player, you can find it here: [react-videoplayer.netlify.com](https://react-videoplayer.netlify.com).
